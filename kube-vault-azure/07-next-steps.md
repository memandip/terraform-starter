# Next Step

> We have launched Vault in standalone mode with a Helm chart. Learn more about the Vault Helm chart by reading the [documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/platform/k8s/) or exploring the [project source code](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm).

> To install Vault in high-availability (HA) mode via the Helm chart, refer to the [Vault installation to Google Kubernetes Engine via Helm](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-google-cloud-gke) tutorial or the [Vault Installation to Minikube via Helm](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-minikube) tutorial for step-by-step instructions.

> The pod you deployed used annotations to inject the secret into the file system. Explore how pods can retrieve secrets through the [Vault Injector service via annotations](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-sidecar), or secrets [mounted on ephemeral volumes](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-secret-store-driver).
